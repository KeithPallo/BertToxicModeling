Moreover, about 56% of British Columbians voted for parties opposed to the Site C dam and Kinder Morgan, so there strong support for those measures. As for proportional representation, the previous referenda were on a kind of instant-run-off balloting system, not PR; so we certainly cannot say that BC ever rejected PR.

meh	0	*	Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.

Tory promised SmartTrack to be at TTC fare, so ideally commuters will be able to take a TTC bus to a SmartTrack station and ride for free. Furthermore, GO-TTC integration is also badly needed within 416, but that doesn't look promising, as Ontario refuses to fund it and is pushing Metrolinx to go with the fare-by-distance model it uses in the 905 and 705 suburbs. If we really want to reduce driving, with their accompanying pollution, accidents, pedestrian crashes etc, Toronto and the Province have to subsidise the TTC and GO more - to the level most other major cities in Canada and Europe are. And not using the lack of transit subsidy to keep property taxes low.

Seeing statewide waste of State funds that continues without checks and balances while hearing about threats on how to hammer the people of Alaska is disheartening.  If the State demonstrates an absolute commitment to skimming the poop off their cesspool of expenditures I am fine with a State Income Tax where individuals and corporations pay their share.  If the State satisfied the people with an absolute commitment and a strong future budget plan then I am sure the people would also be willing to allow a portion of the PFD for a one time expenditure to balance the budget.  But until then forget it.  Trim the fat!

Hawaiian Kingdom entered into 22 Treaties and Conventions with successions. 1893: Illegal Overthrow by Committee of Safety with support of USA Navy.  US President Grover Cleveland and Queen Liliuokalani enter into 2 Executive Agreements: (1) Obligating U.S. to administer laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and (2) Restore the Hawaiian Kingdom government. 1898: - to present: America occupys Hawai`i.

Government HAS to do more for farmed animals. They are sentient beings and in their capacity to suffer they are no different then dogs, cats or humans. I have recently visited the local stockyard in Nova Scotia and witnessed the poor treatment of animals, overcrowded holding pens, young calves standing in mud, urine and feces, covered in feces, they were hit with sticks and electric prods by the workers even though there was no room for them to move and one worker KICKED a diary cow in the udder because she was scared to go up the ramp while being loaded on the truck. These animals were TERRIFIED. This is UNACCEPTABLE. The Canadian animal laws and enforcement are a JOKE. Something has to change. These innocent intelligent living beings deserve better.

If you put the engine under load, the pressure of the rings against the cylinder wall opposite to the direction the connecting rod is pushing against the crankshaft can cause excessive wear.  It is best to get the oil flowing under full pressure and to let the fuel mixture lean out a bit before driving off. That is a good time to scrape the windows. There is a thing called ""bore wash"" which happens when you first start a cold engine.  All the oil washes off the cylinder walls and it takes a bit of time to replenish it and get your compression back."

As a result, those who participate will experience a range of emotional reactions including guilt and grief as with any death, and some will experience mental health problems needing treatment.""  However, many women who surrender their children for adoption also suffer grief and guilt, yet adoption is not viewed as morally problematic. (This has been an emerging area of research in the last ten to fifteen years.) And there are other women who have few problems post-abortion or post-surrender.   According to Rachel's Vineyard's own reports, women have from time to time abandoned their retreats.  Can't get a good handle on any of it. Seems like it helps some and turns others off."

He sees no contraposition with Familiaris Consortio but the Pope apparently does as he fully endorsed the Argentinian bishops' understanding of the Exhortation. Müller interprets AL in the same way as the Cardinals do, the Pope does not. Again you do not comment on the fact that the CDF proposed several alterations to the text because it was unclear and liable to opposing interpretations and none of them were acted upon. If Müller thought that the document was clear, why would he propose these alterations? Müller Is the Pope's doctrinal voice, he cannot speak on this issue against the Pope, he has to support him or else resign.

You can't excuse any PM or government that purposefully turns a blind eye to reports of thousands of murders and then invites the murdering dictator over for a visit.

Under his authority there was never government sanctioned murder and theft like under US backed dictators. Cuba's economy may have flimsy throughout the years but living there was much more preferable then being murdered by US dictators elsewhere.

Now that China has a anti-ship ballistic missile, the DF 21, and Russia has carrier killing technology, in a real war, carriers the pride of the US fleet would be sunk in less than an hour. Today, the awful truth is that the US fleet is only good against little countries without sophisticated arms, which is called ""gunboat diplomacy"".  So instead of building costly military ships and supporting the military industry, the US should rebuild it's commercial fleet and create domestic jobs. That would be a future that's positive for the US and the world."

It again has stepped up to face homophobic fears and the integration of women into the fighting forces.     Authority is a bit like a weapon, it has power, but it also must be directed by the hand of wise leadership.     I'm not an authority centered person, but as I've grown older, I saw the value of authority in a wide assortment of performance driven occupations.    I might be a child of the early 70's in Eugene with a strong anti-authority attitude, but I could never shut off my rational observations either.   Authority works if done with wisdom.     Big lesson, everyone wins when authority allows dissension.    The military is a great example of strong discussion of opinions, but done mostly in private where dissension must be honest and supported, then seen as a measure of integrity not betrayal.  There is no shame in losing a fair fight.

If so, how did he then run what was widely considered Canada's most secretive and untrustworthy Govts?    He was turfed because of his untrustworthiness.  In 2008, Harper ran on balanced budgets.   In fact, Flaherty promised ""No deficit on my watch"".   Meanwhile the opposition was warning about spending and the potential slowdown.  Following his prorogue, he came back with his ""Economic Action Plan"" and proceeded to criss cross the country using tax dollars like a thinly disguised slush fund.   He spent unaccountably, and in huge quantities - never balancing a budget until he was turfed.   BTW, Canada emerged from the recession thanks in large part to banking regulations put in place by previous Govts (regulations which Harper fought) which mitigated the damage from over-leveraged financial institutions."

From my understanding no mine plan was shared / completed for the EPA and Opponents to base their views on, so there is NO SCIENTIFIC BACKING/FACT to such opposition. Without a mine plan, clearly one cannot assess the impact right? Many opponents claim support for science but when it comes to science for Pebble, ignore it. And what do you say to the EPA sanctioned PEER Review from 2013 (scientists concurring with my view).

If the state wants to have prison industries like Washington and other states, then that's fine as long as it pencils out to save money. The prisoners could do this work in a secure environment, (of course!), but the product should be used to feed the prisoners and not compete on the civilian economy. Washington state makes their own uniforms for inmates, creates ornamental and functional concrete products for use in all state facilities, etc. Thus plus side of this type of program is that prisoners actually learn something useful and can return to society ready to be a productive member.

I did not make it clear enough in my comment  what a ""21st Century VERSION""of what used to be known as the State Hospital  might be.

This 21st Century version must be VERY different from what used to be...something that will meet the needs of today. Too many mentally ill and drug addicted being housed in local jails today as the unintended consequence of unavailable treatment. There will still be court commitments but the great majority will likely engage voluntarily and welcome treatment, in-patient or out.

If we'd listened to Dermot all those years ago, Alaska families would have lost thousands of dollars.  Dermot has failed to demonstrate the slightest comprehension about three key points:  1.  Raiding the Permanent Fund will be highly recessionary.  It will pull significant amounts of money (maybe $1,000 per person, per year) from Alaskans.  2.  Raiding the Fund before we make fundamental reforms to state spending is insane.  Alaska spends almost $1 billion per year on corporate welfare.  That is about one quarter of the deficit!  3.  We are giving away our oil.  If oil prices rise just a little bit the value of the oil removed per year will climb to $11 billion dollars.  Presently about $7 billion is taken, tax- free.  Stop the welfare.  Stop the theft.  Then look at alternatives.

That's really it. Everything else is noise.  Whether it's sour grapes or not... [Shrug]... Considering Ward's play, locker room leadership, what the team looked like when he agreed to join, and the attitude he helped instill, I can see him feeling under-respected for his contribution. All employees, whether it's the NFL or a start-up, have pride of ownership and contribution. It's a lousy situation, but temporary. We recovered from losing Doom, and these boards were alight with vitriol for Elway then too. I'm optimistic for Simmons, he looks like he could blossom nicely.

These Title IX proceedings were the epitome of Kangaroo Courts: the rules of evidence didn't apply, accused had no rights to cross-examine the accuser or witnesses, the hearing officers weren't attorneys but were faculty members (gee no bias there), and the hearings applied the civil lawsuit standard. Thousands of accused were railroaded by the Title IX fiasco. Preponderance of the evidence means 51 out of 100 or one more coin flip that you called.   When crimes are committed, there's the criminal justice system. If a victim can't seek redress with the criminal justice system, there's civil proceedings. Both systems are designed to ensure fair and impartial proceedings. Universities completely abrogated any shred of morality by their Title IX Witch Hunts."

I don't think for a minute the Bushites and Obama-Clintonites attacked those countries without knowing ""regime change"" would not happen, but rather chaos, destruction of their economies, and creation of a breeding ground for endless terrorism, endless humanitarian crisis, endless opportunity to intervene in civil wars in order to control the entire Middle East.

meh	0	*	I worked with acting-out children and youth for almost 40 years. mostly as a special education teacher. Special programs are expensive. Their effectiveness depends on many variables, not the least of which is the kid's willingness to change. Openness is often a matter of timing: a kid who is defiant and subversive may encounter a 'reality check' that suddenly makes him open to improvement.   It's helpful when kids realize that there is a spectrum of services and facilities for people (both adults and children) who cannot manage in the regular system and that this spectrum involves increased/decreased freedoms. Some kids are determined to test that system so it's important to have effective responses available when & where they are needed.   Everyone loses when an acting-out child is in an ineffective milieu (home, classroom, residential facility). Staff & parents get burnt out, peers are negatively affected and the child/youth's misbehaviour is encouraged, his attitudes harden, etc.

Many if not most of the cat colonies on Oahu are being sustained by people who leave large quantities of cat food out for them on a very regular daily/nightly basis.  If the State is serious about fixing its cat problem it needs (1) outlaw the feeding of these cats (2) have officers/cameras present at these feeding sites to enforce these laws (3) penalize violators with high fines and jail time.  Also, placing limits on the amount of cat food you can buy wouldn't hurt.  No sane person needs more than 10 lbs of Friskies/week.

There were no clear laws or protocols helping police deal with spousal violence; nor were there safe places to which a woman and her kids could flee for shelter.  Feminists of the time formed the Council, & began lobbying the Legislature for protective laws, for child support laws, for safe shelters and for police training. Their efforts are responsible for the shelter system, the more helpful DV police and Court procedures, & the changed social attitudes about DV..The types of programs & DV interventions needed varied greatly by Region Thus a Statewide Council."

meh	0	*	"Part 1 ""Then let's get on with it!""  Of course we are eager for reform to occur much more quickly because it is pretty obvious in may cases what must be reformed.   Here's the problem. The only way for Francis to implement the reforms we want to see, would be to invoked the universal jurisdiction V1 granted to the Bishop of Rome to impose his own will on everyone, as P6 and JP2 and B16 did. That would required that Francis abandon the collegiality V2 said should govern the Church.   But, CAEL, if Francis acted like P6, JP2, and B16, imposing his will on all Catholics as V1 allowed, then Francis would further legitimize a future conservative pope undoing his reforms!  That is his dilemma. To implement V2 collegiality, he must work with the sad crop of bishops JP2 and B16 gave us. The two synods on the family illustrate his dilemma, and probably shocked Francis to the tip of his non-red shoes."

To oppose some of the neanderthal anti social policies and discrimination that Scheer embraces is not anti Christian. I haven't seen attacks by other parties though it came up in the NDP debates, but people are just getting a look at Mr Scheer who until now has just been a grinning face while they concentrated on  Mr O'leary and Mr Bernier. This is nothing like the Conservatives vicious attacks on Trudeau and Dion and Ignatieff which were launched  as soon as they became leader, this is just people in general  discovering what his guy stands for.

I have to think that Trevor has been spooked by the beatings with injury he took last year and the hits he's taking this year. Self survival is a strong motive and hard to ignore if you still have a working brain. The kid has proved he has the guts but we need some gut checks on the OL.

meh	0	*	Wow, three of the five are MLPs (master limited partnerships) - ETE, PAA and EPO- but the issues with MLPs have not been flagged in the article.  In a nutshell, Canadians should not touch MLPs with a ten foot pole.  Firstly the distributions are distributions of business income, not dividends and hence not covered under the tax treaty on dividends. Therefore the withholding tax is at the highest US corporate marginal rate (35% currently, I believe) and is NOT recoverable in registered retirement plans.   But more concerning is that holders of MLPs are deemed  by the IRS to be conducting business in the US.  Therefore, if the MLP has positive business income, the IRS requires that holders file a US tax return.  Nasty. Don't go there!

However, I expect that if you go to just about any border town and ask if undesirable Mexicans are in town, I bet you would get a hearty confirmation, that there are.   It has also been known for a while that part of the way Mexico handles it's economy is by encouraging people to move north.     By the way, do you think Mexico should be trying to manipulate our election as they are trying to do in an article I posted earlier?   This is also one of the ways they are dumping some of their people into our country.   Should not a country's embassy be promoting citizenship in their own country instead of helping their nationals becoming citizens of another country.

meh	0	*	A few days ago the RG noted a rise in reported hate crimes nationally. In the comment section it was noted that this could be because people feel more free to report, and I agree to this possibility. But if so, it means our earlier numbers were low due to fear of reporting. That's not a good thing either. The RG in this article notes that we're talking about report. That shows journalistic integrity. However, do we believe the local Muslims are reporting more because they feel more free to report? Imagine telling them that their increased reports are only because they feel more free to report, there actually hasn't been more hate crimes and aggression against them. Can we say that? Making American great has included a long history of hate for one group or another: Chinese, Japanese, Irish, Catholics, Blacks, Gays (who did I miss?). And each time there were assumed good reasons for doing so. Some Whites think they are now the endangered group. Maybe they just feel more free to report.

meh	0	*	As a 25 year EMS veteran, I'll say yes and no to your suggestion.  Narcan is a wonderful drug, and a perfect antidote to narcotic overdose.  However there are some issues few people seem to understand, including the ability for withdraw symptoms, a suddenly very combative patient, and the simple fact that Narcan has a much shorter lifespan than the narcotics it is counteracting.  It takes a great deal of time for narcotics to metabolize, Narcan a short time.  I'm unconvinced that simply having Narcan as a personal prescription is all that helpful. That said, there is no reason whatsoever that health aides in the villages cannot administer Narcan.  It can be given in almost any manner, including IM injection and nasally.  The health aides would also be in contact with the ER in  Bethel, with EMTs preparing to fly to the village for more definitive treatment.

You also probably did not think he would then win the Presidency against ""the most prepared candidate ever."" And yet he did.

If you listen to the press, you would think he is an idiot with no skills. And yet here he is. Clearly, the press must be wrong, probably because they have an agenda, don't you think?

Everyone who voted for the other parties suddenly are... excluded from representation in the government!!  (Shocking, I know.)  PR fixes nothing in this argument.  If your party is not in government, your vote has no say.  That is how the system is supposed to work, whether FPTP or PR.  Some party or parties are not in government - they lost, and your vote if you voted for them means nothing.  All you do with PR is put your ""exclusion"" to a second round of negotiation between politicians.  This is a lousy argument to discard FPTP.

meh	0	*	Take a long look at a map of property ownership in the State of Oregon, where the public lands are in color and the private property is uncolored,  white.  And then explain how to finance state, county, local government that have to provide services to all that federal land,  along with the state, county,  local government and private land.  Public lands offering any kind of economic use are constantly under fire by urban based ENGOs,  which are financed by untaxed money from payroll check offs and trust fund and foundation giving.  I guess it is fair when a shark bites off my leg but not fair if it bites off yours.    Oregon's governments need to seriously look at contracting services.  DMV would be a natural fit for Amazon.  Oregon has more employees in the AG's office than most states of our size.  ODOT could contract all its design and construction work.

meh	0	*	While I certainly applaud this new program, I believe that the R-G's gushing editorial is rather misleading. I believe that it has been many years since any significant number of low-level offenders, as referred to in the editorial, have been prosecuted in juvenile court, let alone held in detention. The reason is simple to understand; money. With the county supplying very limited funding, both to the juvenile department and the DA's office, the focus has been on juveniles engaged in much higher level criminal activity. This, of course, makes sense when there are limited resources.   So, while this new program may provide some additional resources to deal with low-level offenders, people should not expect that it is going to save any appreciable amount of money. Of course the most important question is whether this will have any demonstrative impact on recitivism. Designed properly, the program may provide the answer in a few years.

meh	0	*	Thank you for supporting my main premise that our checks and balances are largely working, though that may not have been your intent. It is certainly not what we are seeing from the liberal media.  The recent rulings on the executive order regarding immigration establish a precedent of judicial review over a well established power of the executive branch, not some new thing as you imply. This puts our nation's ability to defend itself promptly against threats from abroad at great risk and could potentially create an imbalance in our system of government. These judges acted politically, not judicially. They are very likely to be overturned by the SCOTUS unless President Trump rescinds his original order and replaces it with one answering the objections. Then we will see if new suits are filed and similar decisions are made by the courts anyway, indicating clearly a plan of obstruction by the Democrats with collusion by the courts. This would be anything but normal.
meh	0	*	"""Mnuchin also said two things about Trump's tax plan that independent analyses do not support. One is the idea that the wealthy will receive no net tax benefits from the plan. The other is that the plan will not add to the deficit, because of increased economic growth. Even the friendliest analysis toward Trump, work by the independent Tax Foundation that the Trump campaign frequently cited to bolster his proposals, finds Trump's plan would add at least $2.6 trillion to the federal debt over a decade, and as much as $3.9 trillion, after accounting for increased economic growth.   The Tax Foundation also finds Trump's plan would boost incomes for the top 1 percent of U.S. earners by between 10 and 16 percent, an amount that dwarfs the benefits lower- and middle-income earners would see from the plan. That's true even though the group factored in Trump's promise to limit deductions for high earners, which Mnuchin reiterated on Wednesday."""
meh	0	*	The insecticides you are thinking of are applied before flowering and after the nectar has dried up. The hives are trucked in and then out. Otherwise, the honey bees would be killed. BTW, honey bees are not native to North America. They are packed into hives and moved around from farm to farm. Most places in the states, the hives are not allowed to over-winter. They live very stressful lives here. Back during the 2005 bee die-off, it was found a batch of diseased queens had been shipped in from Australia.  But we do have bumble bees. A real study would check the native populations for effects.

Her rights over the body of the life within warrants conditions. There is rationality for setting at least a time related-to-gestation limitation on her right and responsibility to ponder, discern and choose.  (Immanent  threat to the life/health of the mother would constitute an exception). Church should be expected to agree to back off  the irrational and insensitive lobbying to total prohibition and restrict that dimension to internal ""formation"", if they insist."

It appears that most of us in the west would be contend with empty grand statements rather than doing the difficult work of tackling root cause of the problems.    Within six months of coming to power, despite strong opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi formed an Advisory Commission on Rakhine and invited Kofi Annan to lead it.  Their final report was submitted two weeks ago.  Within days, Rohingya insurgents launched fresh attacks destabilizing the process. This report addresses root causes of the problem and offers solutions for lasting peace in Rakhine that include a legitimate space for Rohingyas.   Since coming to power, MaBaTha - the ultra nationalist buddhist group - has been banned.    Aung San Suu Kyi needs our support to bring peace in her country.

Both parties engaged in dirty tricks not seen since those of the Nixon regime and they were caught.

Over 40% of voters did not vote- this was an ugly election that dealt with dumbed down topics that was embarrassing and crude.  No wonder citizens opted out.  Trump won the electoral college; which hopefully will soon be abolished.  Trump should tread carefully; he is not likely to do well, let's hope he doesn't bankrupt our country as he did his own businesses so many times and stiffed so many.

Not a single stockbroker or investor of banker or investment house or bank has received so much as a censure, a fine, or imprisonment for their crimes, and there has been nothing done to ensure the whole mess doesnt happen again.

Although the subject is touchy and the headline is basically correct, the press asked the question and they're used to Republicans being silent and trying to be diplomatic about it.  However, diplomacy and silence are not traits associated with Donald Trump so, rather than allow them to put out fake news about phone calls to survivors of our fallen military people, he told them what he did and then put out a fact that they wouldn't report on.   I'm sure General Kelly has told him he wasn't called by the President, when his son died, which probably upset President Trump a lot, so he brought it up.  I'm sure President Obama was NEVER asked a question like this, but the morally bankrupt media will lower the standards to do most anything to President Trump.    Liberals get their panties in a wad and you never know what they'll do.  However, I can assure them, if they do things to President Trump, they may not get the desired result.

Every time Wente writes a column that is not slavishly left leaning and Trudeau worshiping, this weasel trots out his  same old critique of Ms. Wente which has nothing to do with the column at hand nor with much else (with an MA and numerous managerial roles with the Globe she is more qualified than The Boy Blunder).  He is truly beneath contempt.

Most modern 'hate speech' is really just speech that someone disagrees with because they don't like the conclusions, and so you cannot separate their own personal dislike for the concepts from 'hate'.  I much prefer the legal standard, where you have to actually be looking to harm or incite harm against a people before it qualifies.  It keeps the waters less muddy and takes the job out of the mob, and puts it where it belongs with the police.  Making empiricism our standard really means that we're handing the keys to public discourse to some pretty thin-skinned people."

meh	0	*	"The key to the argument that Trump is not lying is the burden of proof requirement that the truth was willfully hidden. One can investigate a possible lie by looking for actions that the truth was covered up, but when it comes to a person knowing the truth when they say a falsehood, we can only claim they have willful intent by knowing their thought process.  Yet, it may be Trump does not think he is lying. By the intent criteria. there is no willful ""misrepresentation of the truth"" (my preferred term). He is not lying. A person who in effect believes their lies is deluded. When they claim conspiracies of millions as a reason for contrary evidence, this may be a delusional disorder.  As far as the RG, I suggest they say Trump has ""misrepresented the facts and claims the discrepancy between his assertions and data presented is based on a conspiracy of the liberal media, fact checkers, political opponents, and foreign operatives."""

The initial treatments will total 21,000$ at minimum with a good dentist, I got a bill for a little over 5k. to fix one tooth before.  The repairs done in dentistry have a limited life period so he will need to go back at least 4 more times.  This doesn't include the cost of his prescriptions, lost wages from missed work etc  The total of his repairs in his lifetime will probably equal 30-33k total.  The pain from needing your teeth done is another matter and usually people do get compensated for pain and suffering.  Plus he has to pay his lawyer who is probably getting 30-33% of whatever he is awarded.   So assume he gets the 100k. He walks away with 66k subtract actual costs to get his teeth done over the life of his dental needs for the tooth. He has 30k pain/suffering.  That's close to norm

Even those Protestants who have ""Sacraments"" they use the same word but mean very different things by the word.  For Protestants, Sacraments are no more than ""Ordinances.""  They do not cause and signify the graces of redemption as they do for Catholics.    Because a priest has received the Sacrament of Holy Orders, he has been configured to Christ in a special way that enables him to celebrate the Sacraments, in particular the Eucharist.  He is called ""Father"" because through the reception of the Sacrament he relates to the people he serves in the manner of ""Father.""  The priest is their head and shepherd.  As I said, Protestants have no concept of this.  For them, there is no ontological difference between the minister and the congregants.  The minister just has a formal commission from the sect and a calling from a particular congregation."

But thanks for acknowledging, at least implicitly, the hypocrisy of ""conservatives"" who do pretend to advocate slavish, literal translation, but only when and how it suits them. What you think ""sounds better"" is irrelevant; what you advocate is a faulty, incorrect, and misleading translation of the Latin. By the way: it is also profoundly, radically wrong to translate ""et homo factus est"" as ""he became man."" The Creed professes (and the Latin indicates) that in the Incarnation the Second Person of the Trinity took on human nature, which he shares with all of us, not maleness, which he shares with only half of us.

Most of what you suggest as ""rational reform"" is flatly unconstitutional.

He is the banalilty of the banality of evil in the Trump Administration. Of course, social liberals probably consider Pence to be worse on LGBT and choice issues, mostly because he is a true believer (or at least a longer term panderer), while Trump may or may not believe what he is saying currently. Still, protest would not mar graduation if they represent student self-expression, which would be likely. Graduation is always memorable. Shouting down Trump would make it memorable for all of us. They may yet shout down Pence.  Chaput suggesting that Trump does not know the true nature of the pro life movement is laughable. It is all about the pander. Trump knows that. Chaput is either like Pence, a misinformed true believer, or just a longer term shill for the GOP.

I doubt, however, such protocol would be provided for Lutherans, as if above canon law, above confession, Catholic practice, etc.  First of all, Lutherans would have no desire to go to a Catholic confession, nor assent to Catholic doctrine, etc. I think German bishops are thinking: why give the Eucharist to Lutherans without any of the duties, responsibilities, penitential pieties we impose on or present to repentant Catholics? To allow open communion (i.e., carte blanche) to all Lutherans would be like treating Catholics (into second marriages, with other impediments) like second class citizens, imposing duties, penance, on them, but not on Lutherans.

If only Weinandy (whose educational background is embarrassingly thin) had treated others the same way.  Take the Elizabeth Johnson case - no dialogue; later investigations proved that Weinandy's complaints were based upon his own misunderstandings of what she studied and developed.  Same goes for Phan.  He is a hypocrite - and should have been sacked years ago by the former and current failed USCCB leadership.

Certainly the call to continence is not one which is heard very frequently in the current age. I would say that from all sides of the debate about such matters in the Church, even the ""conservative"" position, continence is rarely mentioned for fear of communicating that the Church thinks sex is dirty or strictly useful for procreation.

I always thought the government was here to look after the people?  Why would the government not require companies to test at their expense? The lack of common  sense  is typical in government. What would it cost to get the invoices from the chemical companies? Follow-up is key in any business  or  government and you don't  have to be really smart to do it.

So I did some research and found that while being interviewed for the book ""Trump Revealed"", written after he won the nomination and published before the election, he bragged to the authors that in 2nd grade he ""punched his music teacher in the eye because he didn't think he knew anything about music"".  Tells you a lot about the kind of person he was (and still is it seems).  BTW, the teacher, just before his death in 2015, upon hearing that Trump was considering a run for the presidency said ""When that kid was 10...even then he was a little shit.""  Now, if Trump was your son, what would you have done if the teacher or school called you to tell you that?  And what kind of person brags about something like that?"

Five things that are recognized as inherently harmful in Islam and only when they are repudiated and nullified will a true Muslim Reformation have been achieved:   1. Muhammad's semi-divine and infallible status along with the literalist reading of the Qur'an, particularly those parts that were revealed in Medina;  2. The investment in life after death instead of life before death;  3. Sharia, the body of legislation derived from the Qur'an,  the Hadith, and the rest of Islamic jurisprudence;  4. The practice of empowering individuals to enforce Islamic law by commanding right and forbidding wrong;  5. The imperative to wage jihad or holy war

Then Trump reads about Obama's new book deal, the one in which publishers are banking on a reasonable belief that Obama is intelligent and articulate and writes well, and that the book will sell. Trump needed someone to do the homework and write his book for him because he can't sustain his own attention for more than five minutes and certainly cannot write well. And that comparative vision in the media mirror he cannot stand. And at 3am perhaps Bannon is not there to reassure. So he screams Fake News at the top of his lungs and accuses Obama of illegal activity, with no evidence whatsoever. Pure Narcissistic jealousy.

Corruption is now endemic within our police forces, in part because they are allowed to investigate their own.  What is even worse, public protection of citizens is no longer considered their responsibility . That has been enitely replaced by criminal pursuit, in a justice system that that is not only overwhelmed but ineffectual because of rights assigned to accused/convicted with punishments that make a mockery of justice.  Polls consistently show the large majority of public in favor of capital punishment when homicide is both premeditated and beyond reasonable doubt.  Yet, nothing happens. Our so-called democracy is just as fake as the news extolling its virtues. Nothing short of populist revolt will change it

It is a human decision based on motivation to kill. Anyone from age 5-85 can murder but that don't make an adult decision.

Do you have the least idea how much tax the states would need to require to pay for what they get or share with the federal government (no, you don't). This is not state charity. This is state responsibility, and--as I said--the courts have interpreted that responsibility quite differently than you may.

meh	0	*	I find it interesting that when a black person is the killer, the subject of race is automatically raised.  When a Muslim is the shooter, of course, the first consideration is to label him a “terrorist”.  When a white guy is the mass killer he becomes a “lone wolf” or the generalized “gunman”, or a “distraught” individual…even depicted by the President as some sort of abstract “pure evil” a “sick INDIVIDUAL”. The point of the editorial is NOT to deny that black people kill other people, or that there is no such thing as an “islamic terrorist”.  The point is how knee-jerk the characterization of shooters has become based upon race or religion or ethnicity.   We white American Christians get a pass when one of our own goes on a killing spree.  He’s a “lone wolf”.  NOT one of us.  Of course he’s NOT one of us.

They have threatened and terrorised the whites, ignored educating and improving the poor blacks, and allowed a dangerous radical Islamist element to flourish.   Some sort of racial separation needs to happen again. This can work for both groups: whites can feel safe again, and blacks can concentrate on their own betterment in all-black educational institutions.

The latter is always held on 11 November (Armistice Day, marking the end of WW1). Red poppies are worn, commemorating those who died in war (see the poem, ""In Flander's Fields"").  Solemn ceremonies are held at national and local war memorials, where the names of the dead are inscribed, followed by a march by of living veterans from all wars. In the UK, the night before is marked by a national remembrance service, attended by political leaders and royals alike, which does not shy away from describing, to a national audience, the human costs of war.  Remembrance Day in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK is a far more serious event than US Memorial Day (when we honor our war dead) and US Veterans Day (when we honor those who served). Perhaps we should align with the rest of the Anglosphere to regain their meaning."

Thankfully the complex had a no smoking and no marijuana rule, and the property manager was eventually able to evict her when she refused multiple warnings, but not before months of ridiculousness. And yes, I absolutely believe it can cause illness.   No one wants to smell anyone else's smoke or product.

The public reimbursement doesn't cover the cost of running a private surgical clinic - this is normal because if a patient is operated on in a public hospital, the hospital receives lump sum funding to cover this so the surgeon isn't assuming these costs, so they shouldn't get extra for costs not assumed.  I hate the ""jumping the line"" statement.  The government is deliberately limiting the amount of OR time so surgeons cannot handle the patient caseloads.  From a professional point of view, can you imagine how unsatisfying it is to have a 2 year wait list of patients you cannot help because of bureaucratic nonsense?  Surgeons are trying to find a workaround for this and governments are letting them because they don't want to pay for what is needed.  That's why the clinics aren't being shut down."
meh	0	*	I agree, but there is the issue of what if he goes after someone else in a state of delusion or some other fit.  As children we accompanied a friend from Talkeetna to pick up 8 sets of skis from a man in Palmer, Charlie Overby.  His neighbor was elderly, paranoid and delusional.  That man fired a shotgun into our radiator.  The shooter questioned us in a driveway so he knew there were 3 children in the car.  The state troopers were familiar with this man's problems and nothing was ever done.  He wasn't put in a facility or incarcerated or treated for his problems. I don't know what ever came of him or if he had a repeat episode.

Mr. Trump's world needs to include a working relationship with decent countries like Canada and will be used by him to prop up his legitimacy  - he can not afford to alienate every foreign government and the cost benefit for us of this relationship will be golden opportunities.    PM Trudeau needs to stay between the lines of Canadian values and let the support from home and abroad energize his conviction for the fight - President Trump may flame out long before his tenure is complete but depending on who succeeds him, the damage to his country may be permanent and irreversible. History need not be pretty, only accurately recorded.   Let us stand proud as a nation which side of the future we reside.

The base stuck with him while the identity-focused voters fled to the higher bidder for their affections, Trudeau's Libs. Now the Conservatives, sans Harper, appear to be tailoring their approach to appeal to a more mainstream Canadian audience, an audience Trudeau so detests that he denies its existence. So the Conservatives obviously learned something in 2015 while Trudeau thinks the identity game will keep him in power. If I were him I wouldn't count on it.

meh	0	*	Trump's response is far more serious than this single issue or even Donald Trump himself. We have entered an era where über-partisanship has become so extreme that even a breach of America's national security by a hostile foreign power is more acceptable than the possibility of electoral victory by the opposition Party at home.   This goes beyond Donald Trump. It is reflected in John Boehner's invitation to Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress behind the President's back and Mitch McConnell's refusal to appoint a select committee to investigate Russian cyber-interference in American domestic politics. Partisanship trumps everything, even national security and the smooth functioning of traditional democratic governance.   Vladimir Putin is a dictator, a fascist, a cold-blooded murderer and a war criminal. We should be very afraid unless we truly believe that the world between 1939 and 1945 was human civilization's golden age.  http://www.endthemadnessnow.org

I think it could be done with a lot of local activism. Communities/towns/cities could unite to form collectives that would negotiate with local health care providers (not to be confused with insurance companies). Members would pay dues (premiums) directly to the providers. Various levels of membership could be made available so that the young and healthy could join for less dues and so on, on a graduated scale. Members could decide if and to what degree they would provide for the indigent. Collectives could create inter-collective agreements so that medical coverage would be available when away from the collective's local area. Continued"

That was too much work for the state, so they moved them all to a disabled status, got them on social security disability, food stamps and medicaid, then reported back to the feds that they had complied and reduced their welfare rolls. This worked for a while for Hawaii, until the recession hit and real estate prices went through the roof, which accounts for our ever growing homeless population today."

meh	0	*	During the Inquisition, would Fr. Martin recommend to Jews, Muslims (and homosexuals) that were burnt at the stake to understand and have pacience with the Inquisitors? Or do the same with the leppers, when and where they were marginalized and imprisoned in leprosies? Or to women who had black cats and were taken as witches? Is easy to talk when you have the upper hand and a powerful institution behind you. The outcasts can only count with themselves and their inner strenght to deal with anger, revolt and, often suicide and murder -- just have a look at Africa, where the death penalty applied to gays is taken quite lightly by some churches and the Church. The strong must go towards the weakest of our brothers and sisters, not meet somewhere in the middle. Is not this the message of the Gospel? Do Fr. Martin think about this while meditating about the Sermon on the Mount?

meh	0	*	IMHO, it is perfectly acceptable to finish the pour. (To the author: your friend was indeed joking, so I urge you not to take his jest seriously).Allow me to enumerate a few reasons:  1) Judging by one sip may be fine for truly well experienced folks like yourselves, but for the large masses, it may take a few sips to arrive at a conclusion. (That more or less would require to finish the tiny sample!) 2) If indeed one is NOT supposed to finish the sample, then the proper and rule observing *server should* whisk it away, no?  3) The few truly cases where such a process (limiting the sample/sip) IMHO would apply is for perhaps rare wines or expensive ones, so that each drop is savored and enjoyed by all (i.e. more than 1 person).... 4) Some of the wiser servers I have had the good fortune to be in company with, usually when they get the earliest nod of approval will top up the sample glass with the proper pour amount, thus ensuring that no need to finish the sample!

Trolling is a very specific online behaviour that involves expressing an opinion with the sole purpose of getting a reaction from readers. The opinion expressed is not a sincere opinion. The troll gets a kick out of the reaction - the content is irrelevant.   So a troll on a hockey forum might post on a thread about the greatest player of all time and say he doesn't even have Wayne Gretzky in his top five. He probably doesn't believe this, or even care about who the greatest player is of all time at all - the point of the comment is to stir up a reaction.

Why not advocate for lower taxation for the salaried worker, at all levels?   Why not advocate for rolling back the compensation packages of all public sector workers to align with those in the private sector so that taxes across the board could reduced? How about advocatlng for the most efficient delivery of all public services and the cutting of those that are of marginal benefit to only a few Canadians?  Nope - just simply keep raising taxes. Sorry, that ship has sailed.   You and your poorly thought out plan, adopted by the Liberals to garner NDP votes has finally brought Canadians across the country together in opposition.   This fight is just beginning.

Because of bureaucratic hoops and requirements, it is next to impossible to get access to a schedule 1 drug to study it.  Classic catch 22, huh.  In the absence of actual scientific  evidence, it allowed bureaucrats and law enforcement to claim whatever they want regarding its supposed ""danger.""  It took the courage of families fighting deadly and painful illness to work out for themselves that cannabis does actually have medical value who risked prison.

Have experienced grade 12 students unable to make simple change at the level of "" A customer hands you a $5 bill to buy a $2 can of pop ... "" The student went into panic mode and declined to help out ! (I am NOT making tis up !) Later on true Math ( Calculus, Trigonometry, Chemical/Physical reaction equations, statistics, economics, Quantum physics .... ) require this most basic foundation. If this basic level needs to be ""Discovered"" every time a complex application arises we are indeed lost !! As for math teachers ( my now long ago recollection ) - most were abysmally ignorant of the larger context of mathematics in real life applications, especially STEM."

However, after the first four months of 2012, which were all above 2.0%, the PCEPI inflation rate has stayed below 2.0%. For the first 11 months of 2015, inflation was below 1.5%, but otherwise the US Fed has also respected a 0.5% lower bound. There is no reason that the US Fed should have a 2.0% target rate.  Their PCEPI indicator, with its chain Fisher formula has much less upward substitution bias than, say, the Canadian CPI, so strictly on this basis a lower target inflation rate is appropriate.
meh	0	*	I see no reason why the Liberals would feel obligated to propose a Speaker and make way for the NDP/Green coalition. Turkeys are not in the habit of voting for Christmas. That said, both sides of this seem to want it both ways. The NDP/Greens can only form government together based on a cobbled together agreement with the acquiescence of the Liberals. The Liberals meanwhile are not inclined to recognise this coalition as the will of the people, regarding it instead as the will of the NDP/Greens. Yes, it is grubby but it is so on both sides of the Legislature. The reality is that this will be a fine balance and neither side has a clear mandate to govern, regardless of which party provides the Speaker. A snap election seems the most likely outcome of this situation.

One is the Standard and Poors Study (S&P study says Insurers will be profitable in 2018 and there is no death spiral), and the Kaiser Family Foundation Study. After all, only a third of Americans want to see Obamacare repealed. Most want to see it stay with improvements. And SECOND do not use Obamacare repeal and replacement to give rich Americans a huge tax reduction-- an average of $187,000-- at the expense of millions who will lose insurance coverage.

It's the heart of God himself, and the reason for the Incarnation.  We had all better be highly skilled in the art of showing mercy, because if we aren't, what is left us but the full rigour of the Law. And the Law is not merciful.  If you desire mercy, T., in light of moral weakness, learn not to be a prisoner of the Law.

They still don't realise that the first is impossible without the second. In fact, if you approach it this way, there will be no growth. The private sector has to use whatever funds available, to finance the inclusion. That simply leaves no money available to finance the growth part of the equation.  He wants to approach the DTI on ""targeted debt relief for the most vulnerable"" e.g. in cases of reckless lending. At the same time he expects banks to do a little more reckless lending to ""low income housing and transformational agriculture"".  Most of the plan has to do with SOEs and their developmental mandate and somehow getting the private sector involved in government matters. Somehow I do not think they have white monopoly capital in mind for this participation. This is another money transfer scheme to BMC.  Sorry, dead ducks don't fly."

It didn't. Those things never happened. The Big Island probably is the safest place to live if nuked as long as all the fallout doesn't drift up there in Puna.

But I did appreciate Brian Tobin manning up at a seminar to mark NAFTA's 20th anniversary when he faced PM Mulroney and said Mulroney was right and he was wrong about NAFTA.  I would point out that while the new president Clinton and the new PM Chretien signed the new NAFTA agreement, the actual concept and negotiations work was done by the Mulroney and the Bush #41 administrations.  (Like when Trudeau 2.0 and Freelander claimed success for the largest trade deal in history - between Canada and the EU - which was actually almost totally done by the Harper administration.)  You see the spin here?   In the 18 months give or take that the new NAFTA is being negotiated, any criticism on any Liberal policy or decision whatsoever will be claimed by Liberal partisans to be aimed at defeating the trade negotiations.  Perhaps they would like a ""managed"" media such as their preferred trade partner China has."

Sam is a lawyer who is giving up a lot to serve the public and he does it well, looking out for the general interest and not the moneyed interest. Justin is not wealthy and I can see him being pressed to change his lifestyle to not feel completely intimidated in moneyed circles (which actually is a factor in legislative effectiveness, sad as that may be).  With that in mind, I'd like to propose we pay all of the legislators more. (I can hear the ranting and screaming opposition right now)   Really, they are doing an incredibly important job, giving up a lot....how about we pay them double what they are making and maybe they wouldn't be a susceptible to special interests...at least that could be a deterrent for some.   Along with a pay raise, we could crack down on the per diem abuse, which, I must agree, doesn't make sense in Juneau. Let's look at the problem, though, and fix that first.

Not really - the media neglected to give us readers the full context of his comment. So heads up media - we need true facts and context instead of inflammatory headlines followed up with half-stories and opinions. I miss the media we had in Canada before it was monopolized.

You'd never miss Mass or the Eucharist.    As for some rules not making sense:  Not all of God's rules are palatable, or even sensible to us.  Still, do as Jesus said:  ""If you love me, keep my commandments.""  In deference to your well-meaning friends from whom you learned much in the Army:  You could have, if you want, have an army of friends who full of love for the Lord."

I attend an SDA & 2 non denom churches.(one of which is a mega church..12-13K attenders weekly) and the mega church has a weekly feedback card in their bulletins and also weekly the  staff verbally  remind attenders to fill them out so they can get feedback on their sermons and operations. I resent the SDA denomination for the lack of allowing lay feedback to the pastors & administration. I hear more about the shaking in SDA world because of WO, etc and they seem upset or paranoid.

If you carefully read the article, you will find out that the author asks the question that all of us should ask - what is the point to what I am doing? - and answers it in a satisfactory way for himself and, he hopes, for the reader.

meh	0	*	Perhaps there is a different solution that has been totally missed.  Ask yourself, why are these people on probation or in prison?  Because they broke a law.  Many of them more than once!  Simple solution, eliminate all laws and predators see, no more prison problem.  No need for Lawyers, Judges, Law enforcement probation officers, just one big happy family.  Right?  Look at the hundreds of millions of dollars saved.  Or perhaps if that is an unsettling idea, then how about getting to the cause of the problem instead of treating the symptoms and perpetrating the problem by transferring criminals back onto the streets.  The majority of crimes are committed by people with little education, poor self image, no employment, low income, addicted to drugs or alcohol or raised by those who were.  Very few thieves, drug dealers, sexual predators etc do not fit into one of these categories.  Yes, some do but the majority don't.  Either fix the cause or make the punishment a deterrant.

But if someone feels her costume was a way for her to truly come out and show she is a raciest, prejudice person, or wanted to portray a suppressive message to African Americans, they probably couldn’t be more wrong.  I suggest they look into the mirror and not pre-judge her either, or not fail prey to the knee jerk reaction of the uninformed and/or court of public option to quickly race to jury and judgment, based on a news headline.  Bottom line, she was inspired by the book and its author.  She, just like the Author, was “standing up for”, and bringing to light the same injustice many others are fighting for (and she has for years, and I'm sure she has felt some as a woman lawyer also).  It would be more than a shame, if she loses her job unjustly, because some are un-informed, didn’t understand, (or didn’t care to understand her message/intent) and their blind intolerance.
meh	0	*	I just saw that the killer used an assault van in this attack.  This wasn't an ordinary van for regular civilians. This was the heavy-duty type of van for industrial or even military use.   It was high-powered, high-capacity, fully automatic box van, with power steering, and possibly even the tail thing that goes up.  And the van dealer that sells or rents these assault vans does no police background checks, and will give just about anyone the keys and let them drive away for only £55.    Nobody needs an 8-cylinder van with hundreds of horsepower. We would all benefit from reasonable engine capacity restrictions.  Plus we should establish van-free-zones in areas where people may be especially vulnerable to attacks, such as within 5 miles of a school, government office, place of worship, or private residence.   And we also need to restrict compact concealable vans such as mopeds, which criminals can sneak into places where full-size vans are prohibited.

Because they address a collective action problem where the private sector benefits (i.e., the positive externalities) dwarf the cost of the project many times over.  Yet direct revenues are miniscule compared to the private sector benefit (or even to the public sector cost). . Why do we apply a completely different criterion to public transit? . Is that criterion applied to building or repairing roads?  No, we subsides roads (i.e., burning gasoline) to the hilt.   . What pays for transit is private sector benefit, and unless you find a way to tax positive externalities they never pay for themselves through revenue. . Huge conceptual error."

I've decided that the Trump troll is not posting in good faith, and that responding to him serves only to provide him an excuse to continue his campaign to minimize sexual assault and defend the indefensible.  There has not been a single day, not a single moment, since Trump announced his candidacy that a reasonable person could think that this filthy man had even the minimal qualifications for any public office, let alone the presidency.  It's frustrating that it took this long, and this particular incident, to bring him down.  Tonight, he appears to be on the verge of degrading himself, his family, his party and our country yet again and even more than he already has.  November 8 cannot get here soon enough.

Learn some civics.  The Republican Congress has actually gotten bipartisan things done--something the Democrats couldn't and wouldn't do.  The Republicans repealed No Child Left Behind with a bipartisan bill that gives more power to states and communities.  They passed a bipartisan highway bill for the first time in 17 years.  They reauthorized the Older Americans Act, protected service members from foreclosure and suicide, permanently fixed the Medicare doctor payment rate, updated federal job training programs, and a host of other accomplishments for average Americans.  Under the Democrats, there was gridlock.  No  amendments allowed, sorry--even if you're a D.  No wonder Begich had no accomplishments.

A good example on a smaller scale is the Strait of Magellan where all transits are regulated by Chile.

Also, let the people elect the AG, Judges and oil and gas commissioners and eliminate all oil and gas agencies and have only one oil & gas agency that offers the right to a jury trail when in dispute with the government.   Also use the 5 cent per barrel tax that gave 50 million dollars wasting away today doing nothing in the 470 oil spill Fund; simply use this $50 million fund to establish a ""state insured oil & gas program"" and eliminate the outrages cost to bond and permit oil & gas projects!

meh	0	*	"The move away from Defined Benefit Pensions was one of necessity, they just aren't maintainable and never have been.  First off it is important to remember that Defined Benefit pension do not have a very long history in the private sector.  The first might have appeared in the 1920's or 1930's, but they really weren't very common until the mid to late 1960's and started falling out of favour in the mid 1980's.  Since the recession of the early 1990's you'll be hard pressed to find newly created Define Benefit pension plans in the private sector.  So we're really talking about only about a 20 to maybe 30-year ""golden age"" of Define Benefit pension plans.   The reality is that DB pension plans just proved to be unsustainable.  When a recession would hit a company would see revenue plummet at the same time that a DB pension plan required increased contributions.  Revenue declines and cost increases lead to only one thing: bankruptcies, which help no one, least of all plan members."

It's only legitimate interest is in ensuring that children receive an education to the level that we agree upon (currently grade 12).  With that basis, the voucher system becomes obvious.  Currently, private schools compete for students (and school fees) to a large extent on the basis of outcomes that they deliver for students.  Put another way, if they are not delivering acceptable outcomes, parents won't pony up the school fees.  A voucher system would foster that competition among all schools, including competition between schools that provide additional supports for special needs students.

Some anesthetics are a real problem for people with certain genetics that predispose them to problems with vitamin B12 metabolism, among other things.   Some anesthetics deplete B12 significantly.   B12 deficiency is associated with an elevated risk of TIAs and even stroke.  Vitamin B12 deficiency that's bad enough to affect methylation and red cell formation could cause hypoxia.   One big symptom of hypoxia is being confused or disoriented, as well as fatigue.     I understand Mr. Woods used to take B12 shots.   If that's the case and he was doing it to remediate deficiency, he needs to have an expert test all aspects of his B12 metabolism, including genetics.   A particular kind of B12 deficiency could cause spinal problems.   If he was taking the ""wrong"" kind of B12, big problem."

Then reaching out to family, friends and neighbors, with guidance and giving referral to agencies for treatment---is crucial.  The fact that Bishop Malesic is attending every educational component is the mark of a true shepherd, who cares for the people.

In fact the reason torture is so unsuccessful is because people will say anything to get it to stop. Anyone assured of Khadr's guilt better reread the documentation associated with his arrest and imprisonment. Inaddition to a host of other embarrassing alliances with the Americans and their Guantanamo Bay fiasco, they invented a new crime and retroactively applied it to Mr. Khadr. Convenient but sketchy as it pertains to the law that is suppose to balance human rights with human actions. Add to this the inadequate evidentiary trail, the collusion of Canadians involved examining the contradictory evidence underpinning his crime, the child soldier issue and one is left puzzled by the outcry of Canadians over this debacle. Maybe next time Canada should stay on the side of the law and not the Americans.

If you simply reach an agreement with a foreign (or domestic entity) to receive information from that entity it can be a Federal conspiracy and a felony if the information was stolen or otherwise obtained illegally, whether or not you actually get the information or pay for it. Stolen email could also fall into that category of items that are covered by Federal laws. At a minimum you would likely be indicted for conspiracy. Money does not need to change hands, neither does the illegal information. Depending on who is involved there could be other crimes for illegally acting as a US Agent (if you are not one), or for US Agents there are a variety of laws, including failure to report the arrangement. And any lie or act to conceal any evidence or investigation of a possible conspiracy can be obstruction of justice (like Papadopoulos) .

meh	0	*	The market competition argument would apply if there actually were a free market in top executive talent.  In reality there are many capable corporate executives at lower levels in corporations who never have a chance at the top jobs because of the tight control by the elite at the top.  This small clique of closely networked, well-established corporate CEO's, former CEO's, well-connected types, and especially family connected relatives use their power to tightly control who gets selected and how much they get paid.  And of course they all want huge salaries and bonuses and scratch each other's backs with a wink here and excessive greed there!  A truly open market would result in executive remuneration closer to the public sector norm - where very capable execs toil away for very generous salaries when compared to the rest of us - so that the motivation is clearly there.  The proliferation of excessive pay and bonuses  is driven by a clear lack of open competition.

meh	0	*	The Trans Mountain refinery supplies oil to the Chevron refinery in Burnaby. After the new Kinder Morgan pipeline goes in the small existing pipe will be used to send diluent from Asia (where it is cheaper than US diluent) to Alberta. The new big pipe will carry dilbit to the expanded tank farm for export to China. The Chevron refinery is currently up for sale with no takers so far. For this 65 year old refinery to be viable it will now have to get its raw material from the US. This is too expensive. This will likely cause the shutdown of this refinery with the loss of 430 jobs. Tell me again how the Kinder Morgan pipeline is good for us.

Business investment in 2016 was still lower than it was in 2007  Alberta plus a little bit of help from Saskatchewan and BC have been the 'locomotive' for the country's growth, as all other provinces are below the national average for performance  In other words, without the laundering of Chinese money in the top two housing markets, Canada would be sinking fast.

The marketing trick of mentioning ""self administration"" 7 times then omitting an ordinary witness eviscerates the so called safeguards.  The difference is a witness honors and secures our choice without a witness it allows exploitation of all of us all ages via euthanasia.   Falsifying the death certificate serves to block investigations. Instant immunity for all involved even a predatory heir or corporation. The bill does not speak to any time frames so in fact one could be diagnosed and dead in the same day with immunity all before the family knows.  Dangerous to us all, all ages."
meh	0	*	"Have you been to Mexico?  You say they are proud.  Many are and should be of their culutre, religion, lifestyle, but many of them aren't.  It sure doesn't look like that to me in most places.  Pride doesn't look like that.  They are partially at fault, at least.  It isn't just about being poor.  I have known poor people from every race, and I grew up relatively poor.  My parents grew up in the depression, and were poor. Sometimes they had no food, and didn't know when they would eat again.  You can still act with dignity and try hard and be poor.  That takes real courage, and believe me, people notice it.  Mexico is largely a disaster and ""pride"" is often used as an excuse, when much more than that is required.  Many people equate pride with machismo.  It isn't the same thing at all.  False pride is a huge problem in Mexico.  If they come to this country, they should try and assimilate.  Most of them resist this in my experience.  Nor do many of them want to follow our laws or rules."

During dry-spells of weather (or inside low-humidity homes) when the oocysts become desiccated you can even contract T. gondii by just inhaling the air wherever any cats have defecated and the oocysts have become airborne/aerosolized. Contrary to cat-lickers’ self-deceptive myths, a cat can become reinfected many times during its life and spread millions of oocysts each time. It’s now linked to the cause of autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, memory-loss, and brain and prostate cancers; as well as increasing the suicide rate in women almost 2-fold even though they’ve never suffered from any mental or emotional health issues previously.

I agree also for large fines for distracted drivers (there are lots in this city),  fines for cyclists who do not stop at stop signs (many of these) and who should have a bicycle licence earned by learning the rules.

meh	0	*	Of some interest for this discussion:- In today's news (per the 'Vatican Insider' website), it is reported that Bishop emeritus Jaume Camprodon i Rovira, who died in December 2016, gave his bodily remains to the Faculty of Medicine, Barcelona, for anatomical research. He had been bishop of Girona diocese in Spain, 1973 to 2001. In his testament, Camprodon wrote (my translation) that 'If anyone is surprised by the fate of my mortal remains, know that I chose it as contribution to that society from which I have received much, and as gesture of communion with the bread broken and shared at the table of the Eucharist'.  His wishes seem to have caught the Vatican on the hop. Bishop Paglia does his best to give an 'official' response, but he seems to be struggling. No English translation yet.

The 6% increases were transferred to the provinces by Harper by honoring the terms of the accord.   Health care transfers are then in the provinces hands so blame can only be put on them if these increases didn't translate in better delivery of services.

Corporate profits will be held in escrow with zero percent interest. - Put all Americans on Visa's - Expel all non-Canadian Americans who have been resident in Canada for more than 10 years - Do special tax audits of all American citizens and corporations - Install Russian Iskander, S-300 and S-400 systems.

The central government is unable to field their own offense capabilities and despite having a sizable Self Defense Force they aren't anywhere near as prepared for war as the US is. That being said, this isn't about whether or not the US should be in Japan.  The issue with Okinawa is a separate issue. One that dates back to Japan's forced occupation in 1606 by the Satsuma and the eventual annexation in 1879. This was followed by forced assimilation and the dismantling of the once Ryukyuan culture by the Japanese. The real culprit here isn't the US, but the Japanese government. They sacrificed Okinawa in World War 2 and again in the aftermath with ignoring the rights granted to the people by Article 95. Whenever the proposal of a new base is leaked communities around Japan put a stop to it. ""Not in their backyard..."" But Okinawa's is ok. The US sits behind the facade that they're not enabling this suppression of rights."

We were glad of it. Of course more was promised than will be delivered. It's always thus. Politicians get our votes offering what they think we want, all the while knowing that they can't change the structures of privilege much. The power of the ballot is felt every four years, other powers exert influence every day. As voters we evaluate the government's progress, or lack thereof and either give the incumbents another chance or try another party and see how far that takes us.

And the critical point you missed with this one is that Heller was the first decision, not because the court was breaking new ground, but merely because Heller was the first time in the 217 year history of the US Constitution that even the question of whether the Second Amendment protected individual ownership and use for self defense had reached the Supreme Court.  The gun-haters point to Heller and want you to believe they broke new ground, or fabricated a new right  No.  The fact is that until the laws and cases that led to Heller, nobody had ever seriously questioned this understanding of the Second Amendment."
meh	0	*	Trump places 46 out of 58 elections in terms of Electoral College. Since the Electoral College determines the winner, the number of counties won by Trump, which you seem to feel is relevant, is no more relevant than the popular vote, much less so, in fact. The size of EC victory, with popular vote, unofficially determines if a given candidate has been given a mandate for change-of course Trump has been given no such mandate. He lost the popular vote by about -2% or 2.6 million citizens. Of course, you attempted to inoculate your letter from the people who do pay attention to the popular vote by pointing out that the EC goes back to when slaves were still held legally, and the EC of course means nothing in terms of win/loss of the election. For reference, Barack Obama EC numbers: 365 and 332 for 2008,2012, respectively. Pop vote margins +7.27% and +3.86%.  Your letter, while somewhat cute, represents nothing but yet another wedge being driven between the good citizens of this country.

They simply open our sensory gates, our doors of perception.  MAPS & MAPS Canada (which I recently donated to their crowd-finding psychedelic studies, for PTSD) has some good science lectures and documentaries - and then there are tons of great books out there...  Same with THC vs anandamide - it's endogenous, yet people still think of 'pot' as a drug, lol - but these cannabinoids are already with us all and found in mothers breast milk; maybe we should arrest all breast feeding women with the reasoning of these commenters.

And here is another salient point. Pay close attention. I exercise my right to carry a firearm. If you come at me with a weapon, I will not aim to wound you. I will go home after that conflict. You will not. There is no reason that a police officer can't have the same outcome.

If you want to be purely a manufacturing country (think China or Japan) then multiculturalism is a weakness.

If their international trade policy is more than mere transactional machismo, it is implicitly 18th-century Mercantilist with Canada and Mexico envisioned as economic hinterlands to the US's metropolitan centre. 3. Canada may not run a net trade surplus but we do in certain industries (softwood, etc.) and the US will cherrypick for decisive wins.  In short, Canada needs its own detailed list of unfair US trade practices with which to bargain and must be cultivating trade allies and new markets.

meh	0	*	Hi Richard:  It's possible to agree to give someone money just like it's possible to agree to sex.  It's only robbery when you don't consent to somebody taking your money.  Yet the Crown doesn't have to prove that a victim of robbery didn't consent to giving their money away.  Why is that different?  If a victim of robbery were drunk and unable to remember all the details of the incident, would the courts say it can't be proven that you didn't consent to give away your money, and so acquit the robber?  I don't think that happens.  So why would anyone be comfortable with a different standard of proof for sexual assault?  There can always be doubts raised -- it's what is reasonable doubt that we're debating.

Unless regulatory costs are very high, efficient producers should be able to produce consumer ready cannabis at a cost of not more than twenty dollars a kilogram, which is to say two cents a gram, and probably much less. Add markups and costs of transportation in the same range as other similar products, such as herbs, dried fruits, or tobacco, and the retail cost without taxes should be quite a bit less that twenty cents per gram.

Next year, hopefully with the help of new legislators who will place Alaska and Alaskan's interests first, finish the job of creating an oil and gas credit system that rewards those who find new oil and punishes those who are warehousing oil on the North Slope.

His denunciation of trump as a serial adulterer, and possibly committing sexual assault, was an excellent reminder of our call to chastity.  I'm glad Archbishop Chaput also took an opportunity to further expand on church teachings on marriage and the family, in additionly speaking on the dignity of each person and the integrity of our bodies as the reflection of divine creation. Chaput's disgust at the language in the ""trump tape"" with Billy Bush was evident in his frank discussion of the 9th commandment which forbids covetousness of the flesh.     so, say what you will about ole Archbishop Chaput, but i for one think he's a decent, fair, and balanced, guy."

Lance Morris, the soldier who lost vision in one eye, who joined her in the TWO lawsuits, has been extremely deceptive in his many many press interviews.  They took diametrically opposed position when they sued Khadr's father's estate. The USA seized as much of Ahmed Khadr's financial accounts as possible.  Morris and Speer imagined they contained millions, when they might have merely contained pennies.  Anyhow, they argued then that the USA should release all those funds to them, because Omar was nothing more than a pawn of his father, with no autonomy.  Then, years later, when they realized he might get a settlement, they argued Omar was totally autonomous, without regard to being only fifteen.

Here's a beauty of a story: my 3-year-old and I boarded a flight in Chicago carrying two carryons and three personal bags.  None of the bags were full, but we were one over the limit and so an agent refused to let us on.  I took the 5th bag and inserted it into the 4th bag - problem solved.  But the agent would not let us proceed because - technically - we still had a 5th bag (contained in the 4th).  Ultimately we could not board until I emptied the 5th bag and threw it into the garbage can.  None of this was preceded by any arguments with staff - we were simply another pair of passengers trying to board a flight as usual.  I have other examples, but this is my favorite for sheer meanness.

meh	0	*	The sabotage continues.  The Trump administration has let funding for Obamacare’s $63 million in-person outreach program lapse, leading to layoffs and confusion among nonprofits that enroll vulnerable populations in coverage.  The government had previously announced it would cut the budget for Obamacare’s navigator program by 41 percent. But right now, the program has no funding at all. Last year’s grants ran out on September 1, and the administration still has not awarded next year’s money.  The sudden funding halt comes at a critical time for the Affordable Care Act. Navigator groups were just beginning to ramp up outreach for the health law’s open enrollment period, which begins November 1. Now, some have done an about-face: They’ve canceled outreach work and appointments with potential enrollees because they have no budget to cover those costs.

Coal industry employment has already dropped by 90% from its peak years back. These immigrant workers are critical to the success of companies such as Oracle, Intel, Amazon, HP, Boeing, Tesla, Apple, Lockheed and others. The US military even is relying on software largely written by immigrant workers to control all sorts of modern military hardware, a reality that, again, has not hit home with high ranking political figures.

When a party sells their house to a foreign buyer, that buyer in turn will buy another house inhe GTA (I assume few just pick up and move their lives). Then their purchase triggers another sell and buy and so on. If not for the original foreign purchase it is likely that these ripple buys would not occur. So wit this in mind it is possible that the 10% cites actually triggered 30-50% of sales. IMO and the buzz I have heard amongst realtors is what we are seeing results from China tightening money leaving the country as of July 1. This will affect the whole world as it already has. As highly leveraged as Canadians are in concert with income levels it is impossible to believe that local demand pushed up real estate and much more plausible to believe that it is he result of capital flight from foreign countries.

Don't blame the cops for having to do their jobs. Put more effort into training them on how to engage the public.  How to handle a traffic stop where a passenger tells you he's carrying a gun and has a permit.    Train them on how to handle public relations in non violent situations.  But stop blaming them for applying their military training to their civilian jobs.  Some officers need training on not applying military tactics in every situation.  That's something easy to rectify and doesn't require a protest movement.   I'm sorry my opinion was long but I'm very passionate about employing change intelligently without violence. I'm passionate about this being a poverty level issue and not a racial one. I'm passionate about our country healing and becoming stronger and not destroyed from within.

meh	0	*	When the government announced it was sponsoring a large number of Syrian refugees  I looked into the matter on behalf of my church who would surely have sponsored a family of the Syrian Christian refugees.  It would have been a good fit for them and for us.  We have had a large network of individuals who could have supported a family easily.  But sadly the government's position was if our church wanted to support the refugees it had to be a private sponsorship meaning we had to pay for the whole year.  Being in a financially difficult spot at the time my church couldn't take on that financial responsibility.  It's too bad though because had the federal government paid for a family and let my church take care of them they probably would have jobs and much improved English at this point.  It is in the government's long-term financial best interests to let churches and any other group of Canadians do this and support newly arriving refugees.  I hope they learn from this.

Both governments can recoup the initial investment in a couple of years, assuming that these jobs have a multiplying factor of 3 the recovery period will be even shorter. The self driving industry is projected to be worth $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years just for the US (self driving is not just self driving cars but any smart car technology such as lane departure waning system, parking assistance), if Canada establishes a leadership position in this emerging field it will reap big dividends.

I specifically asked if Makaha was next in line, and he said it was. Now, several months later, the election is pau, as it seems is any more road work out in Waianae, and any hope of new pavement for Makaha.  Oh, and that community event?

Petite little Sheila Gunn Reid from the Rebel Media was covering the march when she was pushed and shoved by another big burly male, a rude photographer for the Canadian Press, and then, quite literally, was smashed in the face by another male thug who first bullied her and then smashed her camera into her face. Women witnesses standing around the incident denied anything happened, but the whole thing was caught on video. The women actually protected him as he slithered away. They now have the thug's name and Rebel Media and Sheila are going to take action.

I'm not exactly sure how you recount touch-screen voting since there are no paper ballots. Pennsylvania voters have complained before of the touch-screens record their votes wrongly, usually defaulting to the Democratic candidate. Happened in other states in 2012, too. And, yes, I suspect election fraud in any state that uses touch screen technology. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/28/election-recount-jill-stein-hillary-clinton-donald-trump  It's a system subject to manipulation, so will be manipulated.

Suicide is documented without presence of notes. Only in VERY recent times has it been revealed that trans people suffer so immensely psychologically. Where was all this suffering 200 yrs ago?

Afraid of finding ourselves on a no fly list, a terrorist watch list, or under suspicion for home-schooling our own children.

He further clarified that if this council were to put rail funding in the city budget, would that supersede the other ordinance?    It’s important to understand the impact that would have.  While Bill 42 could be voted down with a 5-4 vote, I think it’s unlikely that a budget bill containing rail funding would get a no vote.  It’s also not as transparent.  Corporation counsel is supposed to respond to the question before the next full council meeting, which is May 10.

If it's ""block off an existing lane for buses & people will leave their car & climb aboard"", I think you will find that has been tried elsewhere, resulting in more congestion & angry commuters.  Your plan that more buses will get people out of their cars is based on a number of assumptions- that existing buses are viewed as ideal but too full, buses can get people exactly where they need to be in approximately the same time as driving, & people don't need to drop/ retrieve kids at daycare/school, visit elderly relatives en route, travel to other work sites/client locations during the day, or the many other valid reasons responsibilities require ready access to transportation for specific locations & timing transit planners can't accommodate.  Assuming transit lines will get most people to work without transfers & significant time, & all they need a car for is commuting, applies to fewer folks than you think."

The bottom line is that I suspect any asset mix shift has already largely happened and now the dis-saving effect is likely to come to the fore

If the numbers game had led to the early downfall of the NDP, the Liberals would have had difficulty mounting a strong campaign or an effective government.  Luckily, the NDP have a history of governing from their ideological position, not from the practical.  The self-righteous moral superiority that so many “progressives” have also infects the NDP.  Working to cancel all the major projects in BC won’t sit well with most voters, particularly the industrial union members. Sending the economy into a tailspin to fulfill the Green’s idealistic notions will cost the NDP even more support.  The Liberals will have time to elect a new leader, to regroup and be ready to take the provincial reins when once again the voters of BC say, “Enough!”  Who knows, maybe this time the electorate will reduce the NDP to one seat, not two as in 2001.

She was on the Board of Education for Fort Frances/Rainy River and so probably met or heard about people who worked in the Residential School system. What's more surprising is that Senator Beyak comes from an town with a very high percentage of indigenous people and many First Nations communities in the surrounding area. She would have heard from those people who knew what had happened and how it had affected people. Quoting Tomson Highway is a strange choice to defend her stance as he has written about the abuse in his novel Kiss of the Fur Queen. Beyak sounds like she's trying to apply lipstick to a pig and it just doesn't make it look any prettier. She's just another example of Stephen Harper's poor judgement.

However, having had kids in school with school lunch accounts, and knowing some cafeteria workers, it's a very silly one.  There have been times I was not notified that the lunch account was empty. Kid (elementary school) lost the first couple of notices, wasn't bothered since he didn't buy lunch every day, just when they served pizza on Friday. A couple of times it over drew at the end of the year by about $1 or less and I was told to not bother, just send a check the first day of school, which I did.  I'd be really curious how many of these accounts actually fall into such categories, and if there are truly large hordes eating the ""sandwich of shame"" on a regular basis."

meh	0	*	In February, the Habs had almost no secondary scoring. Only 4 forwards scored in the entire month, and Pacioretty hauled nearly all the water himself. But in March, the opposite happened. The secondary scoring, if we can call it that, showed signs of life, and Pacioretty's line was fairly quiet. The Habs' record was better when the scoring was spread out a little more equitably and they scored more: 22 goals in 13 games in February, but 37 in 13 games in March. The fourth line, a combination of Mitchell, Flynn, Martinsen, Ott, McCarron, King, contributed 1 goal per month. That's not one goal each per month, that's one goal for the entire line per month. I believe the 4th line has already got their goal for April so for the 10 minutes a game they will play against the Rangers, expect tight checking nothingness. The offence plays a 50 minute game.   So, while the Habs need Pacioretty to lead, if Byron,Gallagher, Lehkonen and Galchenyuk, lines 2 and 3, don't step up, could be a fast exit.

Also, one must separate truly personal attacks from generalizations about groups.  Generalizations are not personal attacks and the best way to address them is to provide evidence that the generalization is false rather than just complain about the generalization.  In your comment above, you could not resist personalizing your comment to assert that I frequently launch personal attacks.

Secondly, the ground rules for capturing and detaining individuals - reliance on third party capture with little or no documentation of guilt, holding detainees incommunicado indefinitely, refusal by our government to allow detainees the right to see the evidence against them, denial of counsel, and denial of habeas corpus ----- all of these shortcuts are not what this country was based on, event during the time of war.

We are being robbed and that is where the focus should be. Many of the oil fields yield no income for Alaska when the producers claim production costs and take cash tax credits from the state.

The fact that drinking alcohol and partaking in cannabis can land one in a police car if driving is disconcerting. So transport services will be needed to help participants make it home without fear of a DUI or similar citation.  I understand that the laws were written somewhat mimicking alcohol, an accepted _inebriant_, but fewer accidents occur when cannabis laws have kicked in. We will see how that unfolds.

This passage is noteworthy among many:  <<That leaves white Catholics with the prevalent and erroneous assumption that racism is only about individuals who overtly convey negative attitudes against people of another race. Condemnation completely fails to address how good white people have long been — and continue to be — complicit in a host of practices and public policies that benefit them to the detriment and devastation of African-American, Latino and First American communities.>>  The notion that racism is simply a matter of personal virtue or conversion is widespread (and certainly not exclusive to white people). That is why so many white people take umbrage when accused of complicity in white supremacy. They view themselves as decent, moral Christians (or what have you) and not racists.  Racism is an ideology that metastasized in the 19th century to justify slavery and has been deployed ever since   to support white supremacy. That is a fact.

At the end of 2012, the UNHCR reported there were an 'unprecedented' 45.2-million refugees so the number only goes UP, which means the UN's program fails by not ensuring refugee-producing nations FACE the reasons for their ongoing instability.  Surely, it would be less costly to help address the underlying causes right there in those lands -- shouldn't the UN be brokering meetings about causes? The UN reports Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan produce the most refugees, but people also come from Asian nations -- even Mexico, a trading partner -- to claim refuge.  Instead of transportation & resettlement programs, plus refugee hearings for millions more refugees every year, spend supportive funds in nations plagued perpetually by the same old long-standing territorial disputes where refugee numbers never decline? Too many gov't programs are self-perpetuating. Change 'at source' is needed.

Even if mercury is removed from gas emissions via scrubbing, mercury along with cadmium, lead, etc. in the residual coal slag is a long term environmental problem as evidenced by breaks in impoundment ponds - Deaths associated with coal extraction exceed deaths associated with shale gas extraction - The shale gas water issues are gradually being mitigated with continuously improving technology and field experience."

Balance can be found when outsiders take a step back and avoid completely dismantling the culture they're stepping into, and insiders are open to carefully considered changes to their culture.  That kind of balance seems like a very tough line to straddle though.

meh	0	*	You're so wrong that all I can do is recommend that you go read some reliable information on the ACA. The ACA was not intended to buy anyone's vote. It was intended to provide health insurance for everyone and has succeeded w/17M so far. The regressives healthcare plans are actually a healthcare plan. It will take away health insurance from 32M people who had it before. Great example from a Senate majority leader who received a free triple bypass in 2003 at taxpayers expense and now wants to screw everyone who paid his bill. He got his, now you go get yours (if you can).

Elimination of the grain export facility. Refusal for 40 years to build the bridges to the Nenana ag lands. Putting the largest pig producer out of business in Fairbanks and foreclosing on the newly built meat processing facility in Fairbanks. Everyone of these anti agriculture decisions came from Juneau.

In fact the pope before John Paul II spoke openly about possibly ordaining female priests so we know, if only 2 popes ago, a Pope was publicly considering ordaining women to priesthood, and Jesus does not state we can treat women differently than men, which he didn't, then there is no scripture support to keep this abuse in place, and because John Paul II was told that he had no basis for making this exclusion a dogma, and that is why JPII didn't claim it was a dogma, nor could he because it doesn't have a basis necessary in scripture or historical agreement of all bishops, then it can't be a dogma.    Doctrines and traditions have changed in our church history.  We used to own black slaves too and only 200 years ago.  Sin must be repented of whether in the form of tradition or doctrine or Jesus tells us he will deny we belong to him.  There is no salvation from Catholicism unless it is first Christian.  Also Pope Francis never confirmed that.

Keep salaries ""even"" with the cost of basic necessities?  Keep everyone's standard of living where it currently is at? What are those necessities and does a salary of $175-$200K+ need a full COLA increase to compensate for inflation?  Also, when COLAs are applied equally to the boss as to the office assistant the math is that both the total and percentage difference between those salaries will continue to increase.

They were well on the way with the full compliance of the Harper Government to reducing the reserve requirements of the Canadian Banking industry.  Fortunatey the Chretien/Martin government had kept the reserve requirements to protect the Banking industry from  collapse.  Fortunately for Canada , the financial collapse that impacted the USA and Europe did not occur, because the Harper government did not have time to destroy.  Of course they took credit for it.   A former stock broker one told me that the closer people are to money, the more crooked they become.  In order he ranked the industries from top to bottom.   Counterfeiters, loan sharks,  stock brokers , then banks.  Now the stock brokers and banks are the same people.

Anyone who keeps non-native animals for pets should need to, by law, contain them in structures that can even withstand hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes. There's no other way around stopping this man-made ecological disaster that these pavement-brained cartoon-educated imbeciles create and perpetuate -- none. I think we should round-up those pet piranhas and put them in pools in the backyards of all these cat-lickers, so they can enjoy their god-given right to exist -- all their boas too. I used to suggest (as example) that if someone insisted on keeping invasive-species community-vermin cats next door, that they should start keeping neutered and spayed pet cobras and let them wander in the cat-lickers' yards.

NK has tested 2 ICBMs and a H-bomb.  Some experts contend that NK has miniaturized nuclear warheads for ICBMs.  NK will not give up their nukes.  Soon they will cross the red line of having thermonuclear ICBM capability.  Now add to this witches' brew the possibility that the Iran nuclear deal is going to collapse and the strong probability that Netanyahu convinced Trump that Iran's nuclear program could be destroyed just as Iraq's and Syria's were by military force.  This is rapidly become a lose-lose nightmare scenario of various nuclear powers going to war on different fronts.  We should be afraid of the possibility of these conflicts turning into WW III."

Let's see what percentage of doctors leave this country if these tax changes go through.  All talk is of the tax changes stopping income splitting but that is a drop in the bucket of what these ridiculous tax changes do - they take away 73 to 93% of savings all small business people, including doctors, have in their holding companies that they saved for retirement.  Most small business people are nowhere near rich - they are the middle class.  This is socialism gone mad.

Misdemeanor crimes such as yelling at one's spouse, loudly slamming a door when exiting a home to AVOID an argument, or even a wife slapping her husband in frustration - ALL can be grounds for denying a citizen's 2nd Amendment right for life.   Do you realize that some venues deny a jury trial for someone facing misdemeanor domestic violence charges?

The U.S.A. has many opportunities for people to make a go of it,but for some that will never be within reach. One of the largest problems seems to be  the people that fall out of the cracks. Too sick, but not sick enough for mental health care, broke, but not broke enough for health care. No way to have a job, because a job requires a car, which requires insurance, which requires a job to pay for it. The never ending circle of despair. My thought is to give them a place to go. A place to have their tent, or structure. Close to services, and bus routes. At least give them the peace of mind that they are not going to get rousted at one in the morning, and told to leave.

That they allot this understanding and caring so far below so many other factors of their vocation, so low that the sexual integrity of children and other vulnerable has so little consideration - THAT is the ""deplorable"".   IF thy did not understand then why did they resist so strenuously? Why spend billions to hid, deny, obfuscate, belittle, resist and continue to do so?   The sense that ""I and my elevated position"" will wait out and survive this painful thorn; that the ""church will survive this irritation""; that  ""reputation"" and ""authority of privilege"" is more important""; being above the law of any land; the arrogance commitment to non-accountability, THESE take precedence over the children, over the healing, the reconciliation and restoration of the Church."

However that don't mean nuthin' since Gouviea is a 'world class' financial exec and the reason why UH chose her to be in charge.  Her 'shift in thinking' that she learned in Waimana Enterprises will be spectacularly applied to her time while in charge at UH for development of new projects.

meh	0	*	Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.

On the Johnson unit, though, I have a different memory....  as I was working at Royal Avenue as a QMHP for Lane Shelter Care for a while  in the 1990s, I recall it was still in operation at Peace Health then.  I don't know if it is still active. I do know that Royal Ave. was closed, a budget cut.  Those who speak so casually about community based  mental  health programs need to recognize how hard it is to create, staff, and fund them.  They should also understand what a really tough job mental health work  is, the emotional toll it takes in  seeing the suffering of people we care about but too often can't help. A typical night at Royal  Ave. was  spent evaluating someone brought in by the police because they were behaving in ways dangerous to themselves or others, and the choice was either the Johnson Unit if it were truly serious, a few days at Royal, back on the streets, or the jail.  Bleak choices.

Some of the treatment facilities that pedophile priests were sent simply asked the priests if they were attracted to children. If they said no, they were sent back to different Churches to minister to more children. After all, we know priests would never lie. Perhaps the pope could send out a questionnaire with regard to homosexuality. If a priest truthfully admitted to their same sex attraction, they could be laicized. If they lied, they would continue in good graces. I am a little confused though.If a priest is expected to be celebate,   what difference does their sexual orientation make.

She violated that oath in favor of her ""religion"". She should have quit her job. That would have been more courageous. When Phillips realized he would be asked to make wedding cakes for same sex couples; the more courageous move would be to close his bakery or stop making cakes and bake bread only.

Crony capitalism is a thing, a horrendous thing, and the party so quick to decry the concept is so quick to display it in full force. Trump's appointees are a who's who of crony capitalists, a new swamp to fill the old swamp. The cognitive dissonance of his supporters is staggering; willfully, enthusiastically, heroically undermining their own self-interests in the name of a party win.

The pension contributions I make don’t have any opportunity for growth, unlike my RRSP or TFSA.  The “employer match” is somewhat meaningless given that pensions are paid monthly and lump sum is not an option. If I live past 80 I will have gotten a deal. If not, too bad.  And unlike self directed plans, there will be nothing left for my family. The death benefit is steadily reduced as you age.  “Nothing stopping anyone” is hardly naïve. I studied hard and worked hard to become a consultant, and after I had proven my worth, was offered a job in the public service. I took it at a big pay cut because I was starting a family and wanted the security.  Public sector jobs are still available to those who are willing to put in the effort -- and understand both the benefits and sacrifices involved.

If you get a patient up, clean them, change them, take them to the sink, wash their face and comb their hair; then by golly, clean their mouths too and reverse the routine at night! No excuse ever for poor oral care. Unfortunately, it is one of the highest neglected areas I have seen in these facilities, mainly because the aids are in a hurry, looking for shortcuts to get to the next resident on their list. Thieves:  There's usually one in every facility. Sometimes it is even a visitor, family member, or another resident and not always is it staff. In some cases I have found a demented patient threw out the item themselves or accidently misplaced it or gave it to another patient. Then claimed it was stolen later. This is why we tell families to keep valuables at home or in a safe.

meh	0	*	<<It's depressing and stressful to contemplate the church's complicity in support for Trump.>>  I was faced with this very predicament at Mass this morning.  The celebrant -- a good man, a good priest -- asserted that a Catholic could not vote for Hillary Clinton. To be fair, he did not mention Clinton's name and he did not recommend a vote for Donald Trump; but his meaning was unmistakable. I did something I haven't done in thirty years or more -- I left Mass after the homily because of the homily.  Already, I regret that I did -- and I'll probably confess it the next time I go to confession.  And I will discuss it with the priest-celebrant.  But this gets precisely to your point -- the church's ministers must find the language to promote Christian and Catholic teaching, and support the exercise of the voting franchise, without being complicit in the election of Donald Trump; indeed, without endorsing anyone.  The single issue approach fails; it leads to simplistic, false conclusions.

Catholic scholars still struggle to deal with long-decided questions of contraception, when real women are asking whether it's okay to give their boyfriends/husbands ""something special"" in order to avoid pregnancy -- and perhaps get a good night's sleep in the process.

Nice Try. LOL...Your post was a joke, right!?

As a result, it's readership is falling almost as fast as Wynne's popularity in the most recent political polls, and I would venture a guess that it's not just some random coincidence that each is on a similar downward trend in terms of public popularity.

Accomplishing it with a “block function” is designed to - using your Venn diagram - carve a public discussion space into small cliques that talk only to each other.  That is one of the reason why the Disqus-based comment and discussion groups, like National Public Radio’s former comment area, are closing down or becoming moribund.  As to “an image of Catholicism as a dungeon of sorrows”, that would be the impression I would form from your posts, so your point is a bit hard to decipher.

There are regions across Canada with unemployment higher then 7% and youth unemployment a whole lot higher. The economics in Europe are predominately in the young demographic, and countries there youth unemployment in the double digits. Eventually as we have seen in Europe, this creates tension and then this escalates into violence. The current problem is going to magnify and I am predicting that this will become the biggest internal problem we have ever faced.

Just seeing this as some doctor trying to squeeze more money for himself out of the system is missing the importance of this discussion.  I don't care one bit about a robot for urology.  But the larger point being made  by the doctor is critical.  Maybe its hard to understand if you don't work in the area and maybe we need to do a better job educating the public about these issues.  There is great benefit to the public in supporting the process of medical innovation in our academic teaching hospitals.  The doctors in these programs actually make less money and work harder.  So your premise is false.

He did not say this, he said that, he should have said this, he should have said that, he did not seem sympathetic, he smiled, he did not smile, he praised first responders but he did not praise them enough and on it goes ad infinitum.  The liberal media also went nuts criticizing and mocking Melania Trump because she wore high heel shoes while on her way to the Marine One helicopter on the White House grounds.  A disaster of epic proportions is occurring in Texas and the media is more concerned about what Mrs. Trump is wearing at the White House.  She changed to sneakers on Air Force One while on the way to Texas and stepped off the plane wearing them.  Nevertheless, some in the media falsely reported that she toured the hurricane area wearing her high heels.   This shows very clearly how corrupt and dishonest the media has become.

Blaming the South for ""trying to destroy America"" is nothing but wasted energy.  The current brouhaha isn't even about the statues.

In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.""  <SNIP>  So people are racist.

Based on that observation I believe we should place Bert at the head of an economic advisory and tax commission and first get the oil taxes and audits taken care of. Give Bert a free hand and complete support. Pay him double.  At the same time put a complete and abrupt hold on all the spending on the maximum size gasline that Walker is spending money down a rat hole to put the project in a regulatory nightmare that insures it cannot compete and cannot be built.  Next look at the strong aviation position we hold at Anchorage and realize that that position is only the ground floor and seek to maximize it.

The generals who have served in Afghanistan-- and just a day ago by Secretary State Tillerson. We are not going to win this on the battlefield or by building a government and nation. We want to keep the government from being overrun tomorrow and the Taliban from taking more territory and get the parties to a negotiated settlement that Trump's people have coneeded will probably include the Taliban. Even with 50,000 or even 100,000 troops a battlefield or military victory is not possible. Like Tillerson says-- our objective is to keep the Taliban from winning on the battlefield.

Now we have a crazy man as president who is ignorant and already in deep trouble on several fronts. More people are speculating on his impeachment.

In other words, if a certain percentage of beach injuries/deaths were caused by the negligent actions of lifeguards, then maybe this bill would make sense.  But there's no evidence of this.  And so this bill doesn't have sufficient reasoning to justify its passage.

Years ago a very liberal professor I knew said  it would be cheaper to pay a criminal $20,000 dollars a year to not commit crimes as  it cost about  $30,000 dollars a year to incarcerate so we'd be saving money!  His  logic left me astounded. To this day I  can still hear the excitement in his voice  as he attempted to convince someone far less 'educated' than he was  of something so ridiculous. To me the idea would be not much more than institutionalized  blackmail.  That idea wasn't exclusively his as others seem to   have  picked up by some in government. Our 'deals' with Korea and Iran have been based on the theory that if we can pay them enough  to 'be nice',  they will. .   Paying extortion  doesn't  work with dictators and it won't work with drug addicts.

meh	0	*	"I disagree with the assertion that ""If one must have a gun, you still have a moral obligation to not shoot it."" Nonsense. The assailant with the knife had a moral obligation not to threaten anyone with it and rob them. He ignored that obligation and our laws that reflect that.  Instead of a moral obligation, the man with the gun had a difficult choice: fire or not fire. He chose not to fire, and as it happens, things turned out well. Sometimes they don't, and the assailant they let escape ends up killing an unarmed robbery victim a short while later.  Carrying a firearm for protection is not a no-brainer. You do have to train yourself, and consider the possible outcomes and your willingness to undergo them. Shooting someone, even a thief or murderer, carries a huge cost psychologically and financially, even if you are clearly in the right. But that may be better than what your family must endure should you fail to defend them or yourself in such a situation."

Lack of legalization has prevented the very studies needed in connection with cannabis, especially with regard to its medicinal properties.   So, it's not possible to put in the time and effort to study it if it remains illegal.  But since people have been using it for five thousand years without a single fatality, let's consider that 100,000 Americans die each year from prescription drugs. Another 100,000 Americans die each year from alcohol-related causes, including car collisions, accidents, and murder and suicide.  That's a million people in just five years.     But hey, we want to keep our priorities straight.  I will grant Gruber this: marijuana is associated with dumbing down the population and increased psychosis, but not among the people who actually use it.

Something about ""thwarting the will of Parliament"".  And, no, the political scene won't be any different with a new Ontario government.

If the minimum wage had stayed the same the labor shortage would have been say 5000 jobs.   The reason why the labor shortage is 'small' not 'big' is because 4950 of those jobs went away because they were no longer cost effective to do at the price of labor.  The rest of my comment shows just as explained above that a high minimum wage COSTS jobs.   No one is willing to pay a person $10 for a task that will bring in $2 in revenue.  No one is willing to pay $15 for a task that will bring in $9 in revenue.   Hell most businesses are not willing to pay $15 for a job that brings in $15 in revenue because with fixed costs that still is a losing money situation for them.

One death was from breast cancer but the other 4 could have potentially been avoided, people in their early 60's that could still be alive.

The FACT that shelters are not at capacity is something our legislators and homeless coordinator are choosing to ignore.  The solution is to create a disincentive for this lifestyle choice and provide more aid and technical training to those in shelters (aka the homeless by circumstance individuals trying to get back on track).  The state needs to stop using AUW as a homeless clearinghouse to distribute funds to waste money non-profits while taking their cut.

Yes, as the Gospels make clear many Jews interpreted the prophecies to mean a civil resurrection of the state of Israel and the removal of the Roman boot from their necks.  Jesus made clear that what not his mission.  Of course I have an idea of what Jews thought about Jesus. He is extremely precise in using word coding that spoke directly to individuals who had huge sections of the OT memorized, who were immersed in a reality unlike our Western thought where the spiritual and physical were one reality.

meh	0	*	My thoughts exactly! I'm glad someone did this because I was ready to grab my phone book in Seattle and look up how many Thai restaurants we have in our area vs how many Thai residents live here. Granted, this article is about Portland, but it reflects exactly my sentiments.  People in Portland can't relate to this article because there aren't many people of color in your area to begin with. It's largely a caucasian population.  We actually have a few asians living in Seattle area and the chances of running into a Thai person here, or SF or anywhere is very small.  Westerners like the simpler food combinations and spicy red peppers. It's one reason you always see spicy sushi being offered. Having spent time in Thailand I have a great appreciation for their food because it is simple and spicy, but it has the savory taste of Chinese food as well.  I have not seen many non-Thai people running Thai restaurants in the Seattle area, if any. I have not seen the crossover that people here do.

Instead, I would permanently station a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) in the area and regulary rotate in a Marine Air/Ground Task Force (MAGTAF) centered on the amphibs with F-35Bs.  The F-35s could provide escort for surveillance due to their stealth and with their sensor package could enhance the mission. The Marines provide the ready threat of 5,000 ground troops that can take back the illegal ""islands"" in the SCS at any time, with sufficient air power to make that happen.

I just finished reading an article by Jonathan Chait in NY Mag which expressed the opinion that while Trump may be losing on policy he's winning his race war. As Chait puts it, ""traditional measures do not capture the most profound changes he has wrought."" Chait calls it ""ethonationalism."" Steve Bannon is key to that. Chait continues, ""In both words and deeds, the White House has established the federal government as the defender of white power in America, projecting a blunt-force message of zero-sum dominance."" As Russia is seen by some as a white bulwark against the invasion of dark Islam, Trump's Russian infatuation makes sense. It's a pity so few people see this."

Therefore people who fail to buy adequate coverage rely on their neighbors to pay their freight. Get your fork off my plate! Isn’t this why we wanted universal coverage to begin with?

It took damn near a year of investigation to find the tapes on Nixon, the Ken Starr investigation of Bill Clinton took 3 years to find the blue dress.  So, while you seem to think that this is over and done with, realize that these things take time, and quite often they find something completely different than what they originally were looking for.  Ultimately I do think that what they are going to find is that Trump's campaign, without his knowledge did actively work with a foreign government to help Trump win, and that Trump's own ego and inexperience is going to land him an obstruction of justice charge for trying to sway the investigation.  As for blaming the Ds, realize that the Ds hold ZERO power in the House or Senate, and that the Rs could decline to hold hearings, that the Rs are holding them should tell you something.

The cost of having to count the single allowed paper meant that I didn't have room to include the traditional homework, which were twice weekly posts.  So the new course required maybe a quarter of what I'd traditionally assigned.  My usual lecture style is back and forth Socratic dialogue with students as we work our way through the various arguments within Philosophy.  Scribd also posted 6 years of my CCA student reviews, and the vast majority of students really liked how I taught.  You are correct that the 80% isn't in that particular document.

I didn't say every person who has ever tried an illegal drug should be in jail.  I didn't suggest that was the reason she was in jail.  I said she broke the law which is a true statement.   Her treatment did not increase the chance of the offender being acquitted. Of course his lawyer said her testimony was unreliable.   He was going to attack her credibility no matter what happened.  It's pretty standard practice for the defence. What do you think he would have said if she was unable to answer questions at all - which is the report from the first day she testified.

So, if that's what theye are good at then why do they continue to say that vapor products could be, may be, might be dangerous on one hand yet say we do not have enough evidence. With the implementation of the new deeming regulations they are also requiring small businesses to do this research themselves and to prove that their product is better, or healthier, than other approved products on the market...like cigarettes. How does that make any sense at all? Isn't it theis job? They want to undermine the vapor product industry and the process they have created is too expensive for 99% of the businesses to complete"

My point is, it's silly to insist on legal claims as a mark of legitimacy. Especially since legal claims (when they did exist) were typically constructed in ways that served the powerful, at least in practice. Much of the legal tradition everywhere is mere window dressing over ""might makes right"" if you go back far enough.  Mr. Saganash gets it half right by questioning the state's ""assumed sovereignty"" and its ""legitimate authority to make laws and policies"".

The FBI has already admitted that they used the fake dossier to get a FISA warrant and that their Russia attribution relies solely on the analysis done by Crowdstrike since the DNC wouldn't let the FBI access their servers.   So the sum of the evidence is a fake dossier and an analysis that the DNC paid for by a company who's founder is vehemently antiputin.   I have another scenario. This thing got too far advanced before people started to realize that the dossier was fake and that crowdstrike's analysis was bull. Their was so much momentum that to admit it was all a fraud paid for by the DNC it would have ruined dozens of careers at the FBI and caused the appeal of literally thousands of convictions because crowdstrike has done tons of contract work for the FBI. Do you understand the legal ramifications when a contractor like crowdstrike is found to be dirty? Legal history is full of bad labs and contractors and how hard LOE defended them until the end.

meh	0	*	It is not that I don't get the argument. But did the government at the time do this to try and stamp out Indigenous culture? Or did they do it because the kids were living in households that were not meeting an acceptable standard of care. Did they purposefully not put the children with Indigenous families or did they simply not have enough Indigenous families to adopt the children? How many Indigenous families are currently on the waiting list to adopt children? How many Indigenous kids are currently in the Child Welfare system? What about Caucasian kids in mixed race homes, or children adopted from 3rd world countries. Do we owe them to?  I just feel like anything you attach the word Native, Aboriginal, or Indigenous to these days is a recipe for lawyers to rape the Canadian taxpayer. I also don't think the endless run of payouts is doing anything to help the image of Indigenous people to the average Canadian taxpayer.

meh	0	*	Why support either individuals or groups who are/allow inebriated at all.  An example, Bean's and Francis  provide addresses for drunks and druggies to collect their SSI/Disability  checks, welfare, pfds.   Without Francis or Bean's  existing those receiving mail there would have to get their shti together to qualify for a proper postoffice  box or save for rent for a UPS type box. In the process of simply qualifying for a mailing address these individuals would already be a step up from the drunken, addicts we see hanging outside the shelters.  Do you think if there was a requirement by Bean's or Francis for sobriety on property there would be many showing up? I think not. Bring these things to a head. Before donating demand the agencies have a zero tolerance policy for those receiving aide.  Best use of donations is to give directly to schools.  Help teachers/principals/staff catch at risk kid's early. Help them support children into healthy, productive, self sufficient adults.

I feel gratitude towards relatively small, ethical farmers who produce food while, at the same time, treating their livestock in a humane fashion.

This is especially true when the increases are for PERS which is a retirement benefit cost that a lot of those on fixed incomes do not enjoy. Social Security gives negative increases. I say this because the last increase was .3% and the Medicare costs more than ate that increase up. Some say that those on a fixed income need to adjust their spending.  How do you do that when the tax rates are going up faster than you can adjust your spending habits while you are trying to maintain the status quo. PERS is killing  this state faster than the tax rates can keep up. The state and the cities need to adjust their spending not the tax payers. At the present rate of tax increases it will only stop when the state and cities get all of our incomes or when the state and cities go bankrupt. What will the end be?

The NDP are like an incubator for policy ideas, occasionally they come up with good ideas, which are promptly stolen by the two major parties. Their role over the years is likened to the constantly complaining friend, never happy, always finding fault,and no way to actually fix it. Eventually they are avoided, the same as the majority of voters have always avoided the NDP. Sure they have some good moments and good people, but then they lapse back into things like the Leap Manifesto, and remind people just why they would never let them govern. If the NDP were clever they would merge with the Liberals, and probably see some of their policies actually see the light of day, while making it more difficult for the Conservatives to get back into power. However no one has ever accused the NDP of being clever.

That's the big difference, we help build anything in Israel it will endure and flourish, same thing you do in West bank you have to be open to Israel Armed forces acting under government to break it down...  The west does not have unlimited resources, hence an independent, an independent Palestinian state would be a better investment to build up rather then cycles of building and destruction.

Hand out leaflets that remind people who buy pot that they should not use it and drive; that it is a criminal offence.    I agree with setting the age to match that of alcohol sales, which was raised to 19 to keep it out of high schools.  We got rid of grade 13, so the age could have been pushed back to 18, but whatever.  Under no circumstances should someone under 19 be charged criminally for possession or what was the point of this.

There also is the matter of comments made by Robert Welch concerning Israel and zionism which are troubling.  AND there was the controversy over anti-semitic remarks made by former JBS President John McManus.  However, I doubt that several hundred Jews would join any organization that actually was anti-semitic.

Energy East was the high cost option so the decision came down to dollars. The other stuff, environmentalist and local government opposition, was not part of the decision making process as far as TRP was concerned. Nor was the regulatory process.  Those rejoicing over the project's cancellation should be a little more circumspect. This is not a win for them.

The evidence of absolute benefit  given in this article would roughly correspond to or exceed  that of  the flu shot, for the prevention of first heart attack through statin usage; or the use of aspirin for stroke prevention to name but three examples.  It is time those who would profit from a product, procedure or intervention were required to disclose this information to patients and to the physicians who prescribe them.

At least vitamin d if d taken in reasonable quantity is inexpensive and  free of risk unlike most pharmaceuticals and is as likely to provide benefit as many of them.

One group had a permit to march, one did not.  The police could have stopped this but they work for the elected officials and do what they are told to.  A close study of the south reveals how the Democrats were the true racist. The Klan, Jim Crow Laws and the history of welfare programs reveal how racist the Democrats are.  The history of the US cannot be changed by the alt-left but attempts to hide the racist history of the Dems can only be done by teachers not exposing students to the truth about our history.  At one time we were the great ""melting pot"" where assimilation was the backbone of our country. Now individuals want to divide us into groups and then pit them against each other.  This is the planned destruction of our country and the evolution of a third world nation."
