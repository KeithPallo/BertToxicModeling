# BERT-Fine-Tuning-on-Toxic-Comment-Regression
Final project for Statistical Language Modeling class at Northwestern University.

Only main BERT files have been included in this repo. In order to run the code, a separate BERT directory with initial model weights should be added. Additionally, when running, the model needs to have an output directory defined. From this output directory, inference can be run after fine-tuning.
